#  Exploratory Data Projects â€“ Big Data Analysis with Pandas & Seaborn

This repository contains a series of mini-projects developed using real-world datasets as part of exploratory data analysis (EDA) training. Each analysis applies different techniques such as visualization, correlation, regression, distribution fitting, and time series cleaning.

All work was implemented using **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** and delivered as HTML notebooks originally prepared for coursework, later refactored and uploaded as standalone data analysis projects.

##  Projects Overview

### 1.  Diamonds Dataset EDA
- Dataset: `diamonds_v10.csv`
- Focus: Data inspection, missing values, column types, distribution of price and carat.
- Visuals: Histogram, KDE, box plot, heatmap.
- Tools: `pandas`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`

### 2.  Football Statistics & Scatter Plots
- Dataset: `data-football.csv`
- Focus: Shots on target vs match results.
- Visuals: Regression lines, scatter plot, correlation analysis.
- Tools: `matplotlib.pyplot`, `seaborn`, `statsmodels`

### 3.  Air Pollution Data (Advanced Cleaning)
- Dataset: `Air_pollution.csv`
- Focus: Null handling, date parsing, rolling mean, forward/backward fill.
- Techniques: Missing data visualization, time series smoothing, datetime conversion.
- Tools: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `imputeTS`

### 4.  Football Time Series (Custom Visuals)
- Dataset: `data-football.csv`
- Focus: Weekly time-based analysis and KPIs (mean/max goals, trendline)
- Visuals: Time series line plots, rolling average comparisons.
- Tools: `pandas`, `seaborn`, `datetime`, `matplotlib`
